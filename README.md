# Overview

Black Duck Fortify SSC service runs in the background as a service, and maps your Black Duck project to one or more Fortify SSC projects. It pushes open source security risk information from Black Duck into your connected Fortify SSC application. The implementation also makes it possible to monitor open source risk and provision the information concurrently into Fortify SSC. This enables you to view and manage see all security risks pertaining to an application in a single view.
